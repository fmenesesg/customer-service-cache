# Spring Boot Infinispan Embedded Sample

The rationale behind this sample and the implementation details are expressed on [this blog](https://blog.ramon-gordillo.dev/2020/12/spring-boot-embedded-cache-with-infinispan-in-kubernetes/)

If you find anything relevant to make it easier or you need some extra information, don't hesitate to open an PR/issue.

Thanks to those that have helped me on the development, particularly those in [jkube slack channel](https://app.slack.com/client/T027F3GAJ/CKATNCPA4) and in the [infinispan zulip channel](https://infinispan.zulipchat.com/)
